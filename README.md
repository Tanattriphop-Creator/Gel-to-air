​"This project is established under the principle of 'Peace and Cooperation for All Life.'"
​The Gel-to-Air project is the foundational core of the Liquid-to-Air system. Our mission is to create life-essential resources through sustainable alternatives, prioritizing technological integration and Open Source systems to decentralize knowledge for the benefit of all humanity.
​💡 Vision and Core Principles
​Public Benefit: All technical foundations are dedicated to the public good, focusing on improving the quality of life and providing basic necessities for sustainable living.
​Decentralization: By reducing reliance on rare-earth mining and proprietary secrets, we empower communities to sustain themselves through accessible, open technology.
​Technical Peace: Creating abundance through innovation to reduce global resource conflicts.

​The Creator: One (1) complete set dedicated for ongoing research and maintenance of the vision.
​The Royal Thai Armed Forces: One (1) complete set for national security evaluation and technical integration.
​Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM): One (1) complete set for public safety, emergency response, and life-saving operations.
​Thai Universities: At least one (1) set per university to serve as a primary resource for education and research for the next generation.
